# Advent of Code 2023 (Golang)

This repo contains my solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) in Golang. Since this serves mainly as a way for me to learn Golang, most of the code here might not be best practice.

To run test for each day

```shell
go test ./challenges/days[insert day number]
```

To run test for a specific part of a day

```shell
go test ./challenges/days[insert day number] -run Part1/Part2
```
